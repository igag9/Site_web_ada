For this question, we need to retrieve gender and age of speakers. This is done with the wikidata parquets. Then, an analysis of these variable can be realized using aggregation, and then statistic and/or distribution.

{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/q1.jpeg" column=3 %}

It can be observed that there are more men who talk about cinema than women. However, if we consider all the subjects in quotebank, we can observe that women are better represented in the cinema world.
