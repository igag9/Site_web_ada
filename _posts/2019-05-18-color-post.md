For this question, we need to retrieve gender and age of speakers. This is done with the wikidata parquets. Then, an analysis of these variable can be realized using aggregation, and then statistic and/or distribution.

{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/q1.jpeg" column=3 %}

This bar plot indicates there are more men who talk about cinema than women.
