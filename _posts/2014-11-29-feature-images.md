Finally, we wonder if it’s possible to predict movie’s genre and ratings regarding several features. We want to test if the memorability of a movie and the gender of actors, directors, producers and writers are predictive of the genre and the rating of a movie. To do so, we will train a model under a supervised learning method, using a logistic or linear regression.
