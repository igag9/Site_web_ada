**Women have always been present in the cinema, but in what proportion? Every year some institutions publish reports whose aim is to show the evolution of the place of women in cinema and point out the inequalities that still exist.**

**The center for the Study of Women in Television and Film made a study on the top 250 films and shows the percentage of women compared to men according to their functions in 2018:**

**The goal of the project is to have a better view of women place in cinema. To answer this question we will rely mainly on Quotebank, which is a database containing citations attributed to individuals, which are extracted from newspapers between 2008 and 2020. This project will focus on data from 2018 and will pave the way for future studies on other years**
