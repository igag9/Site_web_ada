In today's world, gender inequality is a phenomenon that is largely present and the cinema industry makes no exception to the rule. Women have always been present in the cinema, but in what proportion? As inequalities have been largely highlighted by debates or studies during those previous years, a remaining question can be : what is the place of women in the cinema industry, as seen from the point of view of speakers on newspapers ?

The goal of this project is to answer this question. For that, it the will rely mainly on Quotebank, a database containing quotes attributed to individuals, which are extracted from newspapers between 2008 and 2020.  This project will focus on quotes from 2018 and will pave the way for future studies on other years.


## Research Questions

1. Who, in terms of gender, is talking about movies in the newspapers?

2. What are the characteristics of movies that impact their memorability over time? Does the gender have an influence on a movie's memorability?

3. Is it possible to predict the rating of a movie by using Quotebank and determine if gender has an impact on it?
