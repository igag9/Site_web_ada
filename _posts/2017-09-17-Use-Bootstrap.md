For this question we hypothesize that for a given film, the more people who talk about the film the more memorable it will be.
Then when the film is made by many men, it will be more memorable.

The graphs show the proportion of men according to the memorability of the films.

**The first two graphs show the proportion of speakers :**

{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/Q2_a.jpeg,feature-img/Q2_b.jpeg" %}

Both graphs show that the hypothesis is rejected

**The third shows the proportion of participants in the creation of the films :**

{% include aligner.html images="feature-img/Q2_c.jpeg" column=3 %}

The graph, like the other, show that the hypothesis is rejected
