Then, the Wikidata database was used because it contains information about people, films, etc. In order to answer our research questions, we need to extract the gender and age of movies' protagonists (speakers, producers, actors), and the movies' release date. Metadata about Quotebank's speakers are already provided in files speaker attributes.parquet. The informations for other people will be retrieve via the Wikidata API.
